       The goal of Seam  Scheduling is to provide a way to run scheduled events in Seam 3.
       It makes use of CDIâ€™s typesafe event model for tying business logic to schedules.
       That is, you define your schedules using the provided qualifiers,
       which you apply to observer methods containing the business logic that you wish to be run at those times.
